## Pattern Changer

I also made a little device that converts Midi Notes to program change messages to change Patterns on the SP404MK2.

### Installation

1. Download the [.amxd](https://github.com/anzbert/m4l_sp404mk2_busfx/raw/master/Pattern_Changer/sp404mk2_2.0_Midi2PC_v2.amxd) file in this repository and drag it onto a track in Ableton.
2. Set the Midi out of the track to the SP404MK2 and choose the channel corresponding to your Group on the SP. Channels 1-10 send to Groups A-J. So for example, channel 2 sends to Group B.
3. Fun!!!
